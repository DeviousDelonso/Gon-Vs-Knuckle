# Gon-Vs-Knuckle
This program is meant to simulate a battle between the two Hunter x Hunter characters Gon &amp; Knuckle with a turn based system.  Currently, my code is not ready and two logic errors need to be corrected. After I correct those errors and finish the code I aim to find ways to counteract my program's inefficiency.
