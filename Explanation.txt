This program should be able to simulate a battle between the characters Gon & Knuckle from Hunter x Hunter. A turn based system where the user acts as GON vs the computer as Knuckle.
Once Knucklle hits GON, Knuckle lends Aura to Gon that must be paid back with ten percent interest every 10 seconds. If Knuckle hits Gon again his aura debt increases by that amount.

Gon's Total Aura: 21,500
Knuckle's Total Aura: 30,000

Gon's Abilities:
Jajanken Rock - He spends 2000 aura making this attack, it does 2000 aura in terms of damage (not guaranteed, depends on Knuckle's Total Aura)
Jajanken Paper - He spends 2000 aura making this attack, it does 500 aura in terms of damage (can be used as a feint for Rock or after Offensive Ryu)
Jajanken Scissors - He spends 2000 aura making this attack, it does 500 aura in terms of damage (can be used as a feint for Rock or after Offensive Ryu)
Offensive Ryu - He puts the majority of his aura into his fists and feet, creating a three hit combo. He spends 1700 aura and deals 400, 500 or 600 aura damage depending on how many hits landed.

Knuckle's Abilities:
Haymaker - He spends 2000 aura, dealing 500 aura damage and lending his opponent 500 aura
Kick - He spends 2000 aura, dealing 600 aura damage and lending 400 aura
Uppercut - He spends 2000 aura, dealing 700 damage and lending 300 aura
Blitz - He spends 6000 aura, using Haymaker, Kick & Uppercut, dealing 1800 aura damage and lending 1200 aura (very small chance of this happening)

The user will see their Total Aura and how much aura the CPU has as well as the aura stats for each move. They will be given options each time for what move they want to use.

The aura debt created is a seperate value, until Gon pays it back no damage can be dealt to Knuckle.
10% interest is added to the aura debt every 10 seconds (end of each turn)

User wins if they can deplete Knuckle's Total Aura, or land a surprise Rock.
Knuckle wins if user goes bankrupt.
